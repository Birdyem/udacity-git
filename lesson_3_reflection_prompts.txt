When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    Back ups and sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	So that you only update GitHub with stuff you want to share, not 
	anything that isn't ready yet.
